# Taja's Porftfolio

## Description

The motivation behind this project is my desire to break into the tech field and eventually be employed as a web developer. I built this project so that potential employers could take a look at my work and get to know me a bit so they can then determine if I am a good fit. This portfolio solves the problem of employers viewing my work, description of myself, and contact information in a less ideal way because now it is consolidated in one website. During this project I learned that it is perfectly fine to take a little creative freedom, meaning that my work does not need to look exactly like the example.
